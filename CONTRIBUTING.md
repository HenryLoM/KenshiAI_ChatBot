# Coding Standards

When contributing to Object-9, it's essential to follow certain coding standards to ensure consistency and maintainability. Adhering to these standards makes the codebase more readable and makes collaboration smoother.

## 1. Code Formatting

Please adhere to consistent code formatting throughout the project. Use a consistent number of spaces (preferably 4 spaces) for indentation. This helps maintain a clean and readable code style across different parts of the project.

## 2. Naming Conventions

Follow meaningful and clear naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes. Use camelCase for variable and function names, and PascalCase for class names. This enhances code readability and understanding.

## 3. Comments

Include comments in your code to explain complex sections, provide context, and improve overall code readability. Follow a clear and consistent commenting style. Comments should complement the code, making it easier for others to understand your thought process.

## 4. Modularity

Promote modularity in your code. Break down large pieces of functionality into smaller, manageable components. Encapsulate related code into functions or classes. This makes the codebase more maintainable and allows for easier debugging.

## 5. Testing

Write unit tests for your code whenever possible. Ensure that your code passes existing tests and does not introduce new issues. Proper testing contributes to a more robust and stable application.

## 6. Version Control

Follow best practices for version control. Make meaningful and atomic commits with clear commit messages. Reference relevant issues or pull requests in your commits. This helps in tracking changes and understanding the evolution of the codebase.

## 7. Documentation

Update relevant documentation for any changes you make. Keep README.md and other documentation files up-to-date. Documentation is crucial for helping others understand how to use and contribute to the project.

## 8. Licensing

Ensure that your contributions comply with the project's licensing (GNU General Public License) and do not introduce any conflicts. Respect the licensing terms and make sure your code aligns with the project's open-source nature.

By following these coding standards, you contribute to maintaining a clean, readable, and maintainable codebase for Object-9.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before submitting the pull request.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers.
